# Project description:
This project is an implementation of poker in python 3 with both
single-player mode with AI, as well as multiplayer mode with sockets. The only additional module that you have to install is pygame. 

# Running this program:
To run this program, run launcher.py, which gives you access to a single-player mode and a multiplayer mode. If you are running multiplayer mode, one instance of the launcher is required for the server as well as each client, for 5 total instances of python running (4 clients and one server).
